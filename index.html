        <p id="about"> My school is a really good school. All the teachers are nice and teach very very well. We study and also do fun things such as field trips and games. On special days, we do fun projects and fun games and much more! On Fridays, most teachers let the students play for the last 30 minutes of school. But you can only go if you have finished your work on time and have been behaving nicely. In academics, too, they do a very nice job. The youngest grades get math, reading, writing. The others get math, reading, writing, history, science, and once a week, music, P.E, and counseling. The teachers all teach those very nicely. We have to go to the office for help. Thank You!  </p>

    <p id="aabout">My school now has an average rating, but used to have an above average rating. This is because the teachers are very good and have a lot of experience, and they go slow and steady on every subject and wait until the students thoroughly understand. They also let the students have fun and play games and take a little break. Then they will have fresh minds when they come back from the break. What a school!</p>

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

How are students identified for GATE?
Dublin Unified School District (DUSD) uses the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) to identify students eligible for the Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) Program. This test consists of three batteries which measure verbal, quantitative and nonverbal abilities. There are three short tests within each battery.

When is the testing window this school year?
Due to the COVID-19 shelter in place mandate, testing for the 2021-22 school year has been postponed. 

Which grade levels are given the CogAT?
3rd - 7th grade students are administered the CogAT in their classrooms during the end of the second trimester of each school year, if their parents have completed the “permission to test” form prior to the district deadline.

Can students retake the CogAT?
Only students in grades 4 and 5 who have previously taken the CogAT, and did not pass, have the option to register and retest. The retest opportunity is given the following school year. All students must be registered with a parent “permission to test” form in order to retest. The date and time of the test will be posted on the GATE Testing web page approximately a month prior to testing.

What CogAT scores qualify students for GATE?
To be qualified for DUSD GATE identification, students must receive the National Composite Age Percentile Rank (APR) of 98 or above.

How are students new to DUSD identified for the GATE program at our district?
Previously identified gifted students who enter DUSD are considered for GATE identification as determined by the DUSD GATE identification criteria. The parents will need to submit documentation to the school office during enrollment which shows the students’ prior GATE program qualification, along with assessment results that were used for the qualification. Students in grades 3-5 who have not taken a test for GATE qualification prior to their arrival in DUSD must register to take the test.

Do we share information about the CogAT levels? Does the district recommend any materials for preparation to parents?
To maintain test security, we do not provide information about the specific levels of the CogAT that students will be taking. Our district does not recommend any materials for CogAT preparation to parents. Students are encouraged to take the CogAT with minimal test preparation so that we get an accurate measure of the students' reasoning abilities.  

How soon after the CogAT testing date do parents receive the results? How do they receive results?
It typically takes about 8-10 weeks from the first week of CogAT administration for parents to receive results. Results are sent to parent by U.S. Mail. 

What does the GATE program look like in DUSD?   
 2020-21 GATE Parent Presentation 
Grades 3-5 - students who are GATE-identified receive differentiated instruction in classroom settings. In addition, they are encouraged to participate in school and district academic challenges. 
Middle School - students who are GATE-identified are clustered within core subject classes in grades 6-8. All students have the opportunity to be in an accelerated math pathway, based on demonstration of mastery of prerequisite skills.
High School - all students have the opportunity to be admitted into Honors and Advanced Placement classes in selected courses based on performance. Eligibility for Honors and Advanced classes is determined by the results of assessments designed for specific courses and/or by teacher recommendation. The Board of Education recognizes that time spent on purposeful, relevant, and challenging homework extends and enhances student learning and directly influences students' ability to meet the district's high academic standards. Homework contributes toward building self-discipline, time-management, and life-long learning habits; it is an important part of students' daily lives.

Homework is defined as independent preview, practice or completion of skills and concepts taught during class, projects, test and performance preparation, and daily independent reading.

Homework is defined as independent preview, practice or completion of skills and concepts taught during class, projects, test and performance preparation, and daily independent reading. Teachers will align homework with daily lessons.
            
            
            
            
            This is the Gate test. It tells teachers if the students are gifted or not. It has most subjects and you have to fill in the circles on a separate sheet of paper. Fro some it is easy, for some it is hard. Me and my friend Connor are both gifted students. You have to get at least 98 percentile or more. It is in 3 to 5th grade. He passed in 3rd grade with 98 percentile, and I passed with 99 percentile in 4th. There may or may not be some advantages in middle school or more.
